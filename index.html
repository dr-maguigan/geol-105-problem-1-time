	<h3>Problem 1: Geologic Time</h3>
	<h4>The purpose of this activity is to apply logic and the material discussed in lecture to a problem. 
	In this case, you are trying to help someone with no background in geology or understanding 
	of the Earth's age to understand how scientists arrived at an estimate of 4.5-4.7 billion years old.</h4>
	<p>Problem Start: Your goal is to explain to this person how scientists arrived at the current estimate for the age of the Earth.</p>
